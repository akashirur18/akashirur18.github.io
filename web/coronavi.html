            <p class="mb-8 leading-relaxed">Coronaviruses are currently classified as one of the two genera in the family Coronaviridae (Enjuanes et al., 2000b). However, it is likely that the coronaviruses, as well as the other genus within the Coronaviridae, the toroviruses (Snijder and Horzinek, 1993), will each be accorded the taxonomic status of family in the near future (González et al., 2003). Therefore, throughout this review, the coronaviruses are referred to as a family. Both the coronaviruses and the toroviruses, in addition to two other families, the Arteriviridae (Snijder and Meulenberg, 1998) and the Roniviridae (Cowley 2000, Dhar 2004), have been grouped together in the order Nidovirales. This higher level of organization recognizes a relatedness among these families that sets them apart from other nonsegmented positive‐strand RNA viruses. The most salient features that all nidoviruses have in common are: gene expression through transcription of a set of multiple 3′‐nested subgenomic RNAs; expression of the replicase polyprotein via ribosomal frameshifting; unique enzymatic activities among the replicase protein products; a virion membrane envelope; and a multispanning integral membrane protein in the virion. The first of these qualities provides the name for the order, which derives from the Latin nido for nest (Enjuanes et al., 2000a). In contrast to their commonalities, however, nidovirus families differ from one another in distinct ways, most conspicuously in the numbers, types, and sizes of the structural proteins in their virions and in the morphologies of their nucleocapsids. A more detailed comparison of characteristics of these virus families has been given by Enjuanes 2000b, Lai 1997.

                Members of the coronavirus family have been sorted into three groups (Table I ), which, it has been proposed, are sufficiently divergent to merit the taxonomic status of genera (González et al., 2003). Classification into groups was originally based on antigenic relationships. However, such a criterion reflects the properties of a limited subset of viral proteins, and cases have arisen where clearly related viruses in group 1 were found not to be serologically cross‐reactive (Sanchez et al., 1990). Consequently, sequence comparisons of entire viral genomes (or of as much genomic sequence as is available) have come to be the basis for group classification (Gorbalenya et al., 2004). Almost all group 1 and group 2 viruses have mammalian hosts, with human coronaviruses falling into each of these groups. Viruses of group 3, by contrast, have been isolated solely from avian hosts. Most of the coronaviruses in Table I have been studied for decades, and, by the turn of the century, the scope of the family seemed to be fairly well‐defined. Accordingly, it came as quite a shock, in 2003, when the causative agent of SARS was found to be a coronavirus (SARS‐CoV). Equally astonishing have been the outcomes of renewed efforts, following the SARS epidemic, to detect previously unknown viruses; these investigations have led to the discovery of two more human respiratory coronaviruses, HCoV‐NL63 (van der Hoek et al., 2004) and HCoV‐HKU1 (Woo et al., 2005). Three distinct bat coronaviruses have also been isolated: two are members of group 1, and the third, in group 2, is a likely precursor of the human SARS‐CoV (Lau 2005, Li 2005c, Poon 2005).</p>
